In this exercise, you will:
1. Learn about the relevant repositories in the ComplyTime organization.
2. Make your own copy of an initialized trestle-workspace. More info [here](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/creme-brulee/blob/e2574a94f9ac3f85a35d29749d326969d0faafbe/steps/manual_steps.md)
3. Trigger GitHub Actions that allow you to author OSCAL content. 
4. Practice using Git, Markdown, and tools.

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
