## GitHub Branches & Pull Requests

> Imagine your project's code is a main story (the main branch).

**Branches:** When you want to work on a new feature or fix something without messing up the main story, you create a "branch". This is like making a copy of the main story to work on separately. You can make changes and experiments on your branch without affecting anyone else's work.

**Pull Requests (PRs):** Once your changes on a branch are finished and ready, you create a "Pull Request." This is a way to:

> Tell others :clap:: "Hey, I've finished my work on this new part of the story."

**Show your changes:** Let others see exactly what you've done.

**Ask for feedback:** Get your teammates to review your changes and make sure they're good.

**Ask to merge:** Request that your changes be added back into the main story.

So, you branch off to work safely, and then create a pull request to share your work, get it reviewed, and eventually blend it back into the main project.
